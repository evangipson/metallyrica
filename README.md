# MetalLyrica
MetalLyrica is a metal lyrics generator written in JavaScript with a simple front end, which leans toward death metal and black metal.

# TODO
Here's some stuff I plan to do. You can get the full list on the [Issues page for MetalLyrica](https://github.com/evangipson/metallyrica/issues).
- Add ability for more complex sentences.
- Add more metal nouns, adjectives, and verbs.
- Weed out odd-sounding sentences and cases.
